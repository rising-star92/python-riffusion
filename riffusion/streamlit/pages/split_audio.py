            This tool allows uploading an audio file of arbitrary length and splits it into
            stems of vocals, drums, bass, and other. It does this using a deep network that
            sweeps over the audio in clips, extracts the stems, and then cross fades the clips
            back together to construct the full length stems. It's particularly useful in
            combination with audio_to_audio, for example to split and preserve vocals while
            modifying the rest of the track with a prompt. Or, to pull out drums to add later
            in a DAW.
